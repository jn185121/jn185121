I'm a native mobile software engineer at NCR with a primary focus in iOS and a strong foundation in Android. Since graduating from Auburn University in 2019, I have been working daily with Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Java. Outside of development, I have a keen interest in UI/UX and enjoy creating my own iconography and designs in Figma.

I enjoy learning new things and enabling others to do so. Feel free to reach out if you ever want to chat or have any questions!
